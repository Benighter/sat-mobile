### Adding New Features to Showcase
Update the `features` array in `WhatsNewModal.tsx`:

```tsx
const features = [
  {
    icon: <YourIcon className="w-12 h-12 text-blue-500" />,
    title: "Your New Feature",
    description: "Brief description of what it does",
    details: "More detailed explanation of the benefits",
    gradient: "from-blue-500 to-purple-600"
  },
  // ... existing features
];
```

### Updating Version Information
Modify `CURRENT_VERSION` in `useWhatsNew.ts`:

```typescript
const CURRENT_VERSION = '1.2.0'; // Update this for new releases
```

Update `CURRENT_VERSION_INFO` in `versionUtils.ts`:

```typescript
export const CURRENT_VERSION_INFO: VersionInfo = {
  version: '1.2.0',
  releaseDate: '2025-02-01',
  features: [
    'Your new feature description',
    // ... other features
  ],
  // ... improvements and bug fixes
};
```

### Styling Customization
The modal uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by:
- Modifying gradient colors in the `features` array
- Updating the base styling in `WhatsNewModal.tsx`
- Adding custom CSS classes for specific elements

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```typescript
// Force show the modal for testing
import { showWhatsNewModal } from '../hooks/useWhatsNew';
showWhatsNewModal(); // This will reset localStorage and reload
```

### Version Update Simulation
```typescript
// Simulate a version update
import { simulateVersionUpdate } from '../utils/versionUtils';
simulateVersionUpdate('1.2.0'); // Simulates update to v1.2.0
```

### Reset Modal State
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('sat_mobile_whats_new_shown');
location.reload();
```

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- **Keep descriptions concise** - Users scan quickly
- **Focus on benefits** - How does this help the user?
- **Use action-oriented language** - "Upload photos", "Crop images"
- **Include visual elements** - Icons and demonstrations help understanding

### Version Management
- **Update version number** in both `useWhatsNew.ts` and `versionUtils.ts`
- **Add meaningful release notes** with clear categorization
- **Test the modal** before releasing to ensure proper display

### User Experience
- **Don't overwhelm** - Limit to 3-5 key features per release
- **Provide skip option** - Respect users who want to explore on their own
- **Make it accessible** - Ensure good contrast and readable text sizes

/**
 * Manual Test Instructions
 * 
 * To manually test the ministry synchronization:
 * 
 * 1. Create a user in normal mode with a ministry assignment (e.g., "Dancing Stars")
 * 2. Switch to ministry mode and create an account for the same ministry
 * 3. Verify the user appears automatically in ministry mode
 * 4. Update the user's information in ministry mode
 * 5. Switch back to normal mode and verify changes are reflected
 * 6. Create another user in a different constituency with the same ministry
 * 7. Verify they appear in the ministry mode for that ministry
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Users with ministry assignments automatically appear in ministry mode
 * - Changes in ministry mode sync back to normal mode
 * - Cross-constituency aggregation works (users from different churches appear together)
 * - Real-time synchronization occurs without manual intervention

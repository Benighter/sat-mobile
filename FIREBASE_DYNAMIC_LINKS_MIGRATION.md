# 🔥 Firebase Dynamic Links Migration Guide

## 🚨 Critical Notice

**Firebase Dynamic Links will shut down on August 25, 2025.** This guide helps you migrate your SAT Mobile app to use Firebase Hosting for authentication links instead.

## 📊 Impact Assessment for SAT Mobile

### ✅ What's NOT Affected
- Email/password authentication ✅
- Google OAuth authentication ✅ 
- Regular app functionality ✅
- Firestore database operations ✅

### ⚠️ What IS Affected
- **Password reset emails** for mobile app users
- Any future email verification features

### 🎯 Migration Scope
- **Low complexity migration** - only password reset emails need updating
- **No breaking changes** to existing user flows
- **Backward compatible** during transition period

## 🛠️ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. **Install Firebase Admin SDK** (for configuration script):
   ```bash
   npm install firebase-admin --save-dev
   ```

2. **Get Firebase Service Account Key**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Generate new private key
   - Save as `firebase-admin-key.json` in your project root

3. **Set Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./firebase-admin-key.json"
   ```

### Step 2: Update Android App Configuration

✅ **Already completed** - AndroidManifest.xml has been updated with:
```xml
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <data
        android:scheme="https"
        android:host="sat-mobile-de6f1.firebaseapp.com"
        android:pathPrefix="/__/auth/links" />
</intent-filter>
```

### Step 3: Run Migration Script

1. **Test the migration** (recommended):
   ```bash
   node scripts/migrate-auth-links.js migrate
   ```

2. **If issues occur, rollback**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/migrate-auth-links.js rollback
   ```

### Step 4: Testing

1. **Test Password Reset Flow**:
   - Use the "Forgot Password" feature in your app
   - Check that email is received
   - Verify the link opens your Android app correctly
   - Confirm password reset works end-to-end

2. **Test on Different Devices**:
   - Android device with app installed
   - Android device without app (should open web browser)
   - Web browser (should work normally)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Password reset email received
- [ ] Email link opens Android app when installed
- [ ] Email link opens web browser when app not installed
- [ ] Password reset completes successfully
- [ ] No errors in Firebase Console
- [ ] No errors in app logs

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If you encounter issues:

1. **Immediate rollback**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/migrate-auth-links.js rollback
   ```

2. **This restores Dynamic Links** until August 25, 2025

3. **Debug and retry** the migration

## 📅 Timeline

- **Now - March 2025**: Test and implement migration
- **March - July 2025**: Deploy to production and monitor
- **August 25, 2025**: Dynamic Links shutdown (deadline)

## 🔍 Monitoring

After migration, monitor:

1. **Firebase Console** → Authentication → Templates
2. **Email delivery rates** 
3. **User feedback** about password reset issues
4. **App crash reports** related to link handling

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Permission denied" when running migration script
**Solution**: Ensure your service account has "Project Editor" or "Owner" role

**Issue**: Links don't open the app
**Solution**: Verify AndroidManifest.xml intent filter and app signing

**Issue**: Migration script fails
**Solution**: Check Firebase Hosting is enabled in your project

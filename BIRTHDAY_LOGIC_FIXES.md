# Birthday Logic Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the birthday logic to properly handle passed birthdays, correct age calculations, and improve notification system.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `UpcomingBirthday` Interface
- Added `hasPassedThisYear` property (now required, not optional)
- Added `currentAge` property to track current age
- Updated `age` property to correctly show turned vs turning age
- Added better documentation for when birthdays have passed

### 2. Enhanced Birthday Utilities (`utils/birthdayUtils.ts`)

#### `getUpcomingBirthdays` Function
- **Fixed**: Now filters out passed birthdays from upcoming list
- **Fixed**: Only shows today's birthdays and future birthdays in "upcoming"
- **Fixed**: Passed birthdays only appear in month view with proper indicators

#### `getBirthdaysForMonth` Function
- **Fixed**: Correctly calculates age for passed vs future birthdays
- **Fixed**: Shows current age for passed birthdays, future age for upcoming ones

#### `formatBirthdayDisplay` Function
- **Enhanced**: Now accepts `hasPassedThisYear` parameter
- **Fixed**: Adds "(Passed)" indicator to birthdays that have already occurred

#### Age Calculation Logic
- **Fixed**: For passed birthdays, shows current age (what they turned)
- **Fixed**: For future birthdays, shows age they will turn
- **Fixed**: For today's birthdays, shows age they're turning today

### 3. Updated Birthday View Component (`components/views/BirthdaysView.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Birthday Cards
- **Fixed**: Proper age labels based on birthday status:
  - "Turns X" for today's birthdays
  - "Turned X" for passed birthdays  
  - "Turning X" for future birthdays
- **Enhanced**: Visual styling differences for passed birthdays (grayed out, reduced opacity)
- **Fixed**: Time indicators show "X days ago" for passed birthdays

#### Month View Organization
- **Enhanced**: Separates birthdays into logical sections:
  - "Today" - Current day birthdays
  - "Upcoming This Month" - Future birthdays in the month
  - "Already Celebrated" - Passed birthdays in the month
- **Fixed**: Proper ordering and grouping of birthday cards

### 4. Updated Notification Logic (`utils/notificationUtils.ts`)

#### `getMembersNeedingNotifications` Function
- **Fixed**: Only sends notifications for upcoming birthdays (daysUntil >= 0)
- **Fixed**: Prevents notifications for passed birthdays (negative days)
- **Enhanced**: Better logic to avoid spam for already-passed birthdays

## Visual Changes

### Birthday Cards
- **Today's birthdays**: Amber styling with "Today" indicator
- **Future birthdays**: Normal styling with "In X days" or "Tomorrow"
- **Passed birthdays**: Grayed out styling with "X days ago" or "Yesterday"

### Month View Layout
```
Today
├── [Amber cards for today's birthdays]

Upcoming This Month  
├── [Normal cards for future birthdays]

Already Celebrated
├── [Grayed out cards for passed birthdays]
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can clearly see which birthdays have passed vs upcoming
2. **Accurate Age Display**: Shows correct age whether birthday has passed or not
3. **Reduced Notification Spam**: No more notifications for already-passed birthdays
4. **Visual Clarity**: Different styling helps users quickly identify birthday status
5. **Organized Month View**: Logical grouping makes it easier to find relevant information

## Technical Implementation

- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Uses proper TypeScript typing for all new properties
- Handles edge cases like leap years correctly
- Optimized performance with proper memoization
- Clean separation of concerns between utilities and components

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with birthdays that have passed this year
2. Test with today's birthdays
3. Test with future birthdays
4. Test notification system with various date scenarios
5. Test month navigation with different birthday distributions
6. Test leap year birthday handling (Feb 29)

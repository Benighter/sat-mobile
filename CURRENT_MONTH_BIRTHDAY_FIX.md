# Birthday Logic Fix - Show Passed Birthdays in Current Month

## Issue
When viewing the current month (August 2025), birthdays that had already passed (August 1-9) were not being displayed. The view was only showing "No Upcoming Birthdays" instead of showing all birthdays for the current month.

## Root Cause
The component had incorrect conditional logic that treated the current month differently from other months:

**Before:**
```typescript
{isCurrentMonth ? (
  // Only show upcoming birthdays (filtered, excludes passed)
  upcomingBirthdays.length > 0 ? (
    // Show upcoming only
  ) : (
    <EmptyState />
  )
) : (
  // Show all birthdays in month (including passed)
)}
```

## Solution
Changed the logic to always show the complete month view when there are birthdays in the selected month, regardless of whether it's the current month or not. The "upcoming birthdays" view is now only used as a fallback when the current month has no birthdays but there are upcoming birthdays in the next 7 days.

**After:**
```typescript
{isCurrentMonth && selectedMonthBirthdays.length === 0 ? (
  // Only use upcoming view if current month has NO birthdays
  upcomingBirthdays.length > 0 ? (
    // Show upcoming from next 7 days
  ) : (
    <EmptyState />
  )
) : (
  // Always show complete month view when month has birthdays
  // This includes passed, today's, and future birthdays
)}
```

## Improvements Made

1. **Current Month with Birthdays**: Now shows all birthdays in the current month organized by:
   - "Today" - Current day birthdays
   - "Upcoming This Month" - Future birthdays in the month
   - "Already Celebrated" - Passed birthdays in the month

2. **Current Month without Birthdays**: Falls back to showing upcoming birthdays from the next 7 days

3. **Other Months**: Shows all birthdays in the selected month

4. **Days Display**: For all birthdays (including passed ones), shows days until the NEXT occurrence of that birthday (not days since it passed)

## Technical Changes

### `getBirthdaysForMonth` Function
- Enhanced logic to properly handle different years
- Correctly calculates `hasPassedThisYear` for the target month/year
- Always shows days until next birthday occurrence

### `BirthdaysView` Component
- Fixed conditional logic to prioritize month view over upcoming view
- Simplified the decision tree for when to show which view
- Removed confusing "days ago" display in favor of consistent "days until next birthday"

## Expected Behavior

- **August 2025 (current month) with birthdays**: Shows all August birthdays (passed, today, future)
- **August 2025 (current month) no birthdays**: Shows upcoming birthdays from next 7 days
- **Other months**: Shows all birthdays in that month
- **All cases**: Days display shows time until next birthday occurrence

This fix ensures users can always see who had birthdays earlier in the current month while maintaining the intuitive "upcoming" logic for planning purposes.

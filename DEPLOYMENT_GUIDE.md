# Church Connect Mobile - APK Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your Church Connect Mobile app as an APK using Median.co.

## Prerequisites

1. **Median.co Account**: Sign up at [https://median.co/](https://median.co/)
2. **Built App**: Your React app should be built and ready for deployment
3. **Icons**: App icons in various sizes (we've created these for you)

## Step 1: Prepare Your App for Deployment

### 1.1 Build the App
```bash
npm run build:mobile
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

### 1.2 Test the Build Locally
```bash
npm run serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to test your built app.

## Step 2: Generate App Icons

We've created an icon generator for you:

1. Open `generate-app-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click "Generate Icons" 
3. Download all the generated icons
4. Save them in the `public/` folder with these exact names:
   - `icon-48.png`
   - `icon-72.png`
   - `icon-96.png`
   - `icon-144.png`
   - `icon-192.png`
   - `icon-512.png`

Alternatively, you can use the SVG icons we've already created (`icon-192.svg` and `icon-512.svg`).

## Step 3: Deploy to Median.co

### 5.2 Start Build

## Step 6: Install on Your Phone

### Android Installation:
